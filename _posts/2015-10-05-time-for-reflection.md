title: A time for reflection
---

Right now seems like a pretty good time for reflection. We\'ve just finished off
the month of September, which I feel like was a big month for many of us, or
at least it was for me. We\'re also now getting into fall a little more, and saying
goodbye to many of the crazy adventures that came with summer. On top of that,
for those who follow astrology, it\'s been a week since the full moon eclipse/blood moon,
an event that seemed to mark a major energetic shift in the world, and we\'re
also nearing the end of Mercury being in retrograde, a time where things can be
slightly more unpredictable and changing, and occasionally a bit chaotic, which
can often make it a good time to take a look and reflect on where we are and what we\'re doing.

For me personally, especially as I arrive back in San Francisco after an amazing
time back in Ohio, this new part of the year represents a time of bringing more
balance about in my life. After a few months of crazy adventures, and filling my
time with new experience after new experience, it\'s a good time to slow down a
bit and really take some time to focus on myself, physically, mentally, and spiritually.
This means trying to focus my time and energy on those things that benefit me,
and recognizing and cutting out the things that don\'t.  
One big part of this is falling more into many of my practices for self improvement;
from practicing meditation and yoga everyday, running and exercising more often,
taking more time to read and to write, spending more time learning new and interesting
things (german and psychology are top of my list at the moment) and also not forgetting
to give myself time to just relax when I need it (A little Netflix binge watching
every now and then can be a healthy thing, at least in moderation :P).  
Another important thing for me is to be more conscious of what I put in my body.
This means consuming less alcohol, as well as other substances that aren\'t beneficial
to me, but also taking more time to think about the food that I\'m putting in my body;
so making my own food more often instead of eating out, and eating healthy and
vegetarian food whenever possible.  
On top of all that, another major aspect of bringing balance for me is removing
needless distractions and taking more time to focus on work, to help keep my mind
active, alert and creative, but also to help continue making a major difference
with what we\'re doing at Framed. Because I love my job, I love my team, and I love
what we\'re doing, so I want to help us succeed as well as I\'m able, and I do that
by being the best possible version of me, inside and outside of work.

Taking care of ourselves is probably our most important duty in life, and has the
furthest reaching effects as well. We can never fully help others or do what we
need to be doing if we aren\'t caring for ourselves first, and caring for ourselves
means making choices that lead to us being the happiest, healthiest, and best version
of ourselves we can be. So I think it\'s important for each one of us to ask ourselves
more regularly; Is what I\'m doing really best for me, and is it going to help me
be the best me I can be?  
And if the answer to that isn\'t a hearty and healthy yes; then perhaps it\'s a good
time to take a look and see if it\'s something that would be beneficial to change,
and if it is, then the next step is to just do it.

Wishing a very happy Monday to each and every one of you, I hope it\'s the start of an awesome week!
